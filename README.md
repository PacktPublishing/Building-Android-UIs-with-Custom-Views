# Building Android UIs with Custom Views
This is the code repository for [Building Android UIs with Custom Views](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/building-android-uis-custom-views?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785882869), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Many years ago, before the launch of Android and the iPhone, one of the major concerns
was having a central place to purchase and download mobile applications. Nowadays, we
manage to solve this issue with widely available centralized application stores such as
Google Play, at the expense of application discoverability.

Google Play, like any other mobile application store, is highly saturated. Unless an
application does something unique or has something special, it's extremely hard to stand
out from the dozens of applications doing approximately the same, or even if they’re
completely unrelated.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<com.packt.rrafols.customview.OwnTextView
 android:layout_width="wrap_content"
 android:layout_height="wrap_content"
 android:text="Hello World!" />
```

In order to follow the examples in this book, you’ll need Android Studio installed. We’ll briefly cover how to install and set up a device emulator in the first chapter. It’s highly recommended to get at least Android Studio 3.0. At the time of writing this book, Android Studio 3.0 is still beta, but stable enough to develop, run, and test all the examples. In addition, our recommendation is to have an Android device to better experience user interactions in the custom views we’ll create, but they will also work in an Android emulator.
